# LightlyShaders 2.0
 This is a fork of Luwx's [LightlyShaders](https://github.com/Luwx/LightlyShaders), which in turn is a fork of [ShapeCorners](https://sourceforge.net/projects/shapecorners/).  

 This version has almost zero performance impact, as well as correctly works with stock Plasma effects:

# Warnings:

## 1. This is a work in progress branch!
Not all functionality, that was present in previous version is currently implemented. Outline and Wayland support are not working yet. **This branch may contain bugs!**

## 2. This version heavily relies on window decorations, that correctly work with Plasma 5.25 "korner bug" fix!
Currently I can confirm this effect correctly works with **SierraBreezeEnhanced** or default **Breeze** (though Breeze has hardcoded corner radius at 5px).

## 3. This version will only work with GPUs, that support OpenGL 3.0 and above!
OpenGL 2.1 is not supported any more due to relying on textureSize function, which is only present in OpenGL 3.0 and above.
